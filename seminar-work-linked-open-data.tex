\begin{abstract}
Although many universities have already published their public resources according to the Linked Data principles there have not been any efforts at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Vienna). This paper shows international success stories and best practises for applying Linked Open Data at universities. 

Furthermore, this paper aims to discover benefits and challenges of applying Linked Open Data at TU Vienna as well as to discover new use cases and to evaluate known ones from other universities from the perspective of the students. In order to attain this goal a case study was conducted in which \textit{\textbf{five}} persons from students to people affiliated with student affairs participated. These five participants were interviewed by two researchers following a questionnaire. TU Vienna has several faculties including Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering \& Information Technology, which is exactly why the evaluation of the willingness of students to develop applications based on LOD exposed by the university was also part of the case study. 

Finally, a model is suggested that describes how a Linked Open Data effort at a university could evolve. An important part of this model is the provision of public university resources that are demanded by the stakeholders as Linked Open Data. \textit{Students}, \textit{Researchers} and \textit{Administration staff} has been identified as important stakeholders at a university. A technical architecture is proposed for the provision of public university resources as LOD facing the issues of diverging data sources and data formats. Afterwards the most important challenges for the system designer and project manager are discussed including data freshness and data ownership.

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
While the pressure on governments and public organizations to release \textit{Open Data} has significantly grown with the spread of information systems, there has been also a need for \textit{linking} these data from various sources to understand the information as a whole.

Open Data includes non-privacy-restricted and non-confidential data. Therefore any restrictions in distribution are prohibited and data is funded only by public money.~\cite{janssen_benefits_2012} The application domain for Open Data providers is not restricted by its nature in any way and ranges from traffic, weather, statistics to budgeting in the public sector. Just the publication of Open Data seems not enough but in addition the implementation of a feedback loop result in \textit{Open Government}. This has the advantage of a constant adoption to the citizen's needs instead of just visualizing former closed data. 

Despite its wide adoption of Open Data it does restrict the published Data format in any way, thus complicating the integration of heterogeneous data sets. The World Wide Web has proven great success spreading knowledge of various data sources all over the world. The building block of the Web are documents and links connecting them to form a global information space. This can be seen as the key success factor in its nearly unconstrained growth~\cite{jacobs_architecture_2004}. 
Following these principles of publishing and connecting data on the Web is known as \textit{Linked~Data}. More technically, it refers to machine-readable data which is linked to external data sets and can in turn be linked from other data sets. 

\cite{berners-lee_linked_2006} developed a five star rating scheme for classifying \textit{Linked Open Data}, which combines Linked Data and Open Data. The scheme ranges from one star describing Open Data only to five stars describing Open Data in a machine-readable format using open standards with links to other data sets.

Although Linked~Open~Data offer universities new opportunities for providing unprecedented insight into its core activities and ease application development, a major \textbf{problem} is that \textbf{Linked~Open~Data has not been widely adopted by universities yet}. Even tough there are a few examples~\cite{daquin_members_2014} of publishing university related data as Linked~Open~Data, there has been little knowledge of using Linked~Open~Data for publishing university related information. 

The remainder of this section states the addressed research question of this paper, describes the contributions in the course of investigating the research questions and gives an overview of the structure of this paper.


\subsection{Research Questions}
\label{introduction:research-questions}
The fundamental research questions underlying this paper is:
\begin{displayquote}
\textit{How can Linked~Open~Data help to improve processes in university context and how can it be successfully applied?}
\end{displayquote}
More concrete this paper concentrates on the following specific research questions:
\paragraph{Q1: What are best practices regarding the applicability of Linked Open Data in university settings?}
As of now, there are no established best practices for the use of Linked Open Data due to its little adoption in university contexts. For this very reason it is crucial to identify strengths and limitation from previous experiences~\cite{daquin_members_2014} of using Linked~Open~Data as core technology. 
\paragraph{Q2: What are major benefits and barriers for each stakeholder and what are useful use cases?}
We identified three different stakeholders in university context \textit{Students}, \textit{Researchers} and \textit{Administration staff}. Since the success of any new technology highly depends on the acceptance of the stakeholders, the needs of each of the target groups needs to be examined. Furthermore, use cases are important to showcase profits and shortcomings to a non-technical audience. 
\paragraph{Q3: What are major challenges for the implementation of a Linked Open Data~solution?}
As the implementation of a Linked Open Data solution is a time consuming task, the knowledge of probable challenges from the technical perspective as well as from the management perspective is a key factor for the successful adoption. 
\paragraph{Q4: How would a prototypical implementation of Linked~Open~Data look like?}
Among the various existing data sets available it needs to be investigated if a (semi-) automatic transformation is feasible or is the manual data provision enough. In addition, from an implementers perspective of view, critical factors regarding the storage and retrieval of Linked~Open~Data need to be identified. 

\subsection{Methodology}
Finding an answer for the research questions above has lead to the following three methodologies:
\paragraph{A coordinated set of semi-structured interviews}
To answer research questions~(RQ) two to four, we interviewed a selected set of stakeholders representing \textit{Students}, \textit{Researchers} and \textit{Administration staff} respectively. Semi-structured interviews were selected as the means of data collection because they are well suited for exploring the impressions and interests of the interviewees as in a discussion while still following a defined structure. 
\paragraph{Litrature Review}
Undertaking a litrature review to justify scientific contributions and making sound conclusions is an established practice in any scientific community. Since our scientific work targeted in particular to the Semantic Web community, we made some pre-assumptions of a basic understanding of the technologies and concepts regarding Linked Data. More specifically, the concept of an ontology and example knowledge descriptions languages describing these will not be covered in this paper. 
\paragraph{Conceptual System Design}
The development of applications based on Linked Open Data requires a methodology which describes a common understanding of the overall system infrastructure. Therefore we designed a conceptual model of a prototypical implementation of a Linked Open Data solution. 

\subsection{Contributions}
The work in this paper mainly contributes to different aspects which need to be considered when designing and implementing a Linked Open Data application.
More precisely, our contributions can be categorized into the following four areas:
\paragraph{1. Identifying best practices for Linked Open Data in university context.}
Due to the crowing complexity and the large amount of data information systems need to process, there has been the need to efficiently handle Linked Data as well. We gave a brief overview of the already published research work regarding Linked Open Data in university context. In particular, we compared the profits and shortcomings in existing Linked Open Data solutions. 
\paragraph{2. Finding benefits/barriers with additional use cases for stakeholders.}
As with every software project the very first phase of the Software Development Lifecycle~(SDLC) is the \textit{Evaluation of the Requirements}. As a Linked Open Data solution has additional requirements to the structure of the data and due to its open nature, we investigated if the overhead compared to an established technology (e.g. a database based solution) is worth the effort. A set of selected participants from the areas Research, Student~Affairs and Administration are interviewed at the University of Technology in Vienna and their benefits/barriers are compared. Additionally, we proposed several use cases emphasising their point of view. 
\paragraph{3. Discovering possible obstacles for implementers of a Linked Open Data Solution.}
As the application domain for a Linked Data is limited to the university context, our work includes a defined set of Linked Open Data applications which were merged together from the conducted interviews. That use cases showcased probable shortcomings which might arise before, during or after the implementation.
\paragraph{4. Sketching a prototypical implementation of a Linked Open Data solution.}
In consideration of the above mentioned obstacles of a possible Linked Open Data solution, we gave an outline of a prototypical implementation. It begins by covering the whole process of data provision and ends by applications made for end users. 
\subsection{Structure of this Paper}
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{related-work} provides a summary of existing efforts and works related to the research of this paper. Section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges} discusses the methodology as well as the results of the conducted case study concerning research question 2 and 3 from the perspective of students. Section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort} presents a model for describing how an LOD effort can evolve at a university, section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal} proposes a technical architecture for applying Linked Open Data principles to public resources of universities and section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges} discusses challenges. Whereas section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal} is targeted to readers concerned with information \& communication technologies and software architectures, all other sections requires no deeper technical understanding of Linked Data than provided by the introduction, 
Finally, conclusions are drawn in section \ref{conclusion}.

\section{Related work}
\label{related-work}
This section gives a brief overview of existing work relating to Linked Open Data~(LOD) in educational contexts. In particular we investigate experiences and established practices in that area. Fortunately there has been plenty of work done especially around \textit{Linked Universities}~(section \ref{related-work:linked-universities}), an alliance of european universities. Next, selected participants of that project are briefly discussed who had gained great experiences at publishing educational resources. Although beneficial, but many contributions lead to divergent data sets and concepts. The project \textit{LinkedUp}~(section \ref{related-work:linkedup}) tries to combine several of those facilitating a uniform view of these concepts.

\subsection{Linked Universities}
\label{related-work:linked-universities}
'Linked Universities' is "`\textit{an alliance of european universities engaged into exposing their public data as linked data}"'\footnote{\cite{daquin_linked_2014}} providing help and knowledge for other universities that wish to expose their public university resources as Linked Data. Addressing the problem of connecting data and developing new sites by inexperienced universities, the alliance provide information so they don't have to be re-learned. For this purpose the Linked Universities offering a portal as collaborative space with common vocabularies and practices for reusing, describing and sharing. 

Their goals are:(~\cite{daquin_linked_2014})

\begin{itemize}
\item "`Identify, support and develop common linked data vocabularies, usable accross universities for common concepts such as courses, qualifications, educational material, etc."'
\item "`Describe reusable recipes, and share reusable tools, for exposing linked data in universities"'
\item "`Support, through experience sharing and reuse, initiatives towards exposing university data as linked data"'
\end{itemize}

The members of this alliance are:(~\cite{daquin_members_2014})
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Open University, UK
	\item University of Münster, Germany
	\item Aalto University, Finland
	\item University of Southampton
	\item Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) / MetaSolutions AB
	\item Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece
	\item Ege University, Turkey
	\item Charles University in Prague
	\item Universitat Pompeu Fabra
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example: The Open University and the LUCERO Project}
LUCERO (Linking University Content for Education and Research Online) was a project from the Open University, funded for 1 year by the JISC Information Environment 2011 Programme under the call Deposit of research outputs and Exposing digital content for education and research. Aim of the project was to "` \textit{ scope, prototype, pilot and evaluate reusable, cost-effective solutions relying on linked data for exposing and connecting educational and research content}"'.\cite{daquin_lucero_2010} The projects connected with other organizations through LinkedUniversities.org to gather common issues and practices. The outcome was the first university linked data platform, \url{http://data.open.ac.uk/}, with much impact on The Open University and the education community.

\subsection{LinkedUp project - Linking Web Data for Education}
\label{related-work:linkedup}
The LinkedUp project\footnote{\url{http://linkedup-project.eu/}} is a project funded by the European Commission aimed at pushing forward the exploitation and adoption of Linked Open Data in educational organizations and institutions. This project started on the 1st November 2012 and lasted about 2 years. 

More specifically, the projects main objectives are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Open Web Data Success Stories}~\\
	The identification of innovative success stories using tools and data sets in the education sector helps at spreading knowledge and awareness of Linked Data 
	principles. 
	\item \texttt{Web Data Curation}~\\
	The collection of relevant educational data sets facilitate the integration of third party data and applications. 
	\item \texttt{Evaluation Framework for Open Web Data Applications}~\\
	Evaluation of successful large scale applications driven by Linked Open Data promotes the adoption of Linked Open Data especially in educational contexts. 
	\item \texttt{Technology Transfer in the Education Sector}~\\
	The promotion of Linked Open Data technologies is an explicit goal of the LinkedUp project. 
\end{itemize}

The outcome of the LinkedUp project to investigate the goals listed above are several so-called \textit{"deliverables"}\footnote{\url{http://linkedup-project.eu/resources/deliverables/}}. 

Below, there is a list of the most relevant deliverables:
\paragraph{State of the art and data assessment}~\\
In this report~\cite{herder_state_2013} a comprehensive study on the developments in the field of Linked Data and
related fields of educational data mining and learning analytics is given. The report resulted from a collaboration between the Leibniz University of Hannover, the Open Knowledge Foundation, the Open Universiteit Nederland, the Open University, Elsevier and Exact Learning Solutions. The authors first briefly describe fundamental technologies and concepts, namely Linked Data, educational data mining and learning analytics used throughout the paper. Several candidates representing each of the two basic data mining principles~(\textit{data harvesting} and \textit{distributed search}) for heterogeneous data sets are presented. The field of learning analytics focuses on techniques targeted at analyzing and understanding educational learning processes and environments. A complete discussion on this topic though, was out of scope since this is a relatively new research area. Next, challenges and barriers concerning the heterogeneity of open educational resources are investigated. Techniques trying to solve isolated data sets include \textit{schema mapping} and \textit{classification and clustering}. Finally, data sets from the LinkedUp repository\footnote{\url{http://data.linkededucation.org/linkedup/catalog/browse/}} and possible legal obstacles and solutions to these are assessed. 

\paragraph{The LinkedUp Challenge(s)}
The LinkedUp Challenge\footnote{\url{http://linkedup-challenge.org/}} was organized as three separate challenges \textit{Veni}, \textit{Vidi} and \textit{Vici} ending on October 2013, April 2014 and November 2014 respectively. While the goal of the first competition~(Veni) was developing a \textit{"prototype or demo that uses linked and/or open data for educational purposes"}, the Vidi challenge was targeted at finding \textit{"innovative and robust prototypes and demos for tools, which still may contain bugs, as long as it has a stable set of features and there is some proof that us can be deployed on a realistic scale"}. The rationale of the latter, yet more advanced challenge was to build \textit{"advanced prototypes and tools that should be mature and stable; it should be used or have been used by a fair amount of users on a realistic scale"}~\cite{herder_linkedup_2014}. 
The combined goal though was to promote creativity and innovation in ways to mash-up and link educational resources and services. In addition, companies, universities and government agencies were encouraged to share and (cross-)link to educational and non-educational assets. 

The winner for Veni was \texttt{Polimedia}\footnote{\url{http://www.polimedia.nl/}}, an application facilitating large-scale, cross-media analysis of the coverage of political events.
\texttt{TuvaLabs}\footnote{\url{https://tuvalabs.com/}} won the first place of the Vidi competition aimed at transforming open data into opportunities for meaningful teaching and learning, equipping teachers and students with high quality, consolidated data sets. Finally, \texttt{Flax}~(Flexible Language Acquisition)\footnote{\url{http://flax.nzdl.org/}},
the winner of the Vici competition, was designed to automate the production and delivery of interactive digital language collections and targeted to non-expert users~(e.g. language teachers, language learners, subject specialists, instructional design and e-learning support teams). 

\paragraph{Evaluation Framework}
\cite{drachsler_final_2014} proposed an evaluation framework throughout the three web open educational data competitions Veni, Vidi and Vici, described in detail in the last paragraph. The aim of the evaluation framework was to evaluate the usefulness, usability, acceptance and appropriateness of the contributions to the LinkedUp challenges. Therefore experts had to define and/or refine assessment criteria and indicators for measuring the quality of the framework. Practically the frameworks usefulness and ease of use was tested through a questionnaire and interviews. A detailed questionnaire for each of the three challenges as well as the final version of the evaluation framework are accessible at \cite{drachsler_final_2014}. 

\subsection{Austrian Open Data}
\label{related-work:austrian-open-data}
In Austria datasets of various governmental units from different areas of life are exposed on the open data portal \texttt{data.gv.at}. Whereas this data portal is restricted to governmental units\footnote{Member of 'Cooperation OGD Austria'}, \texttt{opendataportal.at} provides a platform for anyone who wants to share data in an open way. In both cases the category \textit{'Bildung und Forschung'} (German for education and research) is especially of interest for (Linked) Open Data initiatives at Austrian universities. Overall, the published data sets are mainly localizing points of interest (libraries, museums and universities) and apart of the Vienna University of Economics more specific information like provided courses and curricula has not been published yet about universities. In fact, the Vienna University of Economics is already active and publishes mainly course information and library collections in a machine-readable and open way on their open data portal \texttt{data.wu.ac.at} and on \texttt{opendataportal.at}. All in all the amount of data concerning education and research on the mentioned Austrian data portals is negligibly at the moment of writing.

Meanwhile data is exposed in machine-readable and open formats, there has been little effort taken to provide it as Linked Open Data. However, Christian Weiss has designed a system\footnote{\url{http://cweiss.net/lod/} last accessed on 15.03.2016} in connection with his master thesis\cite{weiss_transferring_2013} to provide a subset of the Open Government Data provided by Vienna (\texttt{data.wien.gv.at}) as Linked Open Data. In the same year 2013 the project LODPilot\footnote{\url{http://lodpilot.at/}} was initiated to create an infrastructure to provide the basic datasets published on \texttt{data.gv.at} and \texttt{data.wien.gv.at} as Linked Open Data.

Beside the open data portals, \texttt{Wegweiser}\footnote{\url{http://www.wegweiser.ac.at/}} is an early attempt of a set of Austrian universities to share information of public interest like course information, curricula and building plans in an open way. The information on Wegweiser is served only in a human readable format and therefore not easily processable by computers so that applications based on it can difficultly evolve. Furthermore, the service is not maintained any more and outdated. \texttt{Open Street Maps}\footnote{\url{https://www.openstreetmap.org/}} is a global service that make spatial information of Austria (a.o.), which has been collected by an open community, available in an open way. The University of Leipzig has build an infrastructure to provide this collected information as Linked Open Data with the project named \texttt{LinkedGeoData}\footnote{\url{http://linkedgeodata.org/About}}. \texttt{DBPedia}\footnote{\url{http://wiki.dbpedia.org/}} is another project of the mentioned university that extracts knowledge from Wikipedia and transforms it into Linked Open Data. For example, \texttt{DBPedia} contains a machine-readable description of the Vienna University of Technology\footnote{\url{http://dbpedia.org/page/Vienna_University_of_Technology}}. \texttt{Wikidata}\footnote{\url{https://www.wikidata.org/}} is a project similar to \texttt{DBPedia} and also provides knowledge about Austria in a machine-readable format.

\section{Benefits and challenges of using Linked Open Data at universities}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges}
As mentioned in the introduction, we identified \textit{students}, \textit{researchers} and \textit{administration employees} as import stakeholders at a university. This chapter describes the methodology and results of the conducted case study, where \textit{students} and persons affiliated with \textit{student affairs} at the Vienna University of Technology were the case. The essential question of the case study was RQ2; what are the major benefits and challenges for students if certain university resources are published as Linked Open Data and which needful use cases can result out of this from the perspective of the students. RQ3 played a minor role in the case study, because \textit{students} are in general on the consuming side of information technology at a university. However, there are \textit{students} who are operating information systems (e.g. wikis or internet forums), which collect a not insignificant amount of knowledge, which is why this research question was also of interest. The case study was conducted at the Vienna University of Technology, where teaching and research is focused on engineering and natural science.  It has several faculties including Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering \& Information Technology, which is exactly why the exploration of the willingness of students to develop applications based on LOD was also a goal. \textbf{5} participants from student representatives, teaching \& administration personnel to ordinary students participated in the case study.

A case study concerning \textit{researchers} was conducted by Lukas Baronyai \cite{baronyai_publishing_2016} and another one concerning \textit{administration employees} by Stefan Gamerith \cite{gamerith_linked_2016}. 

The first section describes the applied methodology (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:methodology}). The results are split in three sections; the first one describes the background of the interviewees (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:interviewees}). The second one describes the proposed use cases and the evaluated acceptance of them as well as examined additional use cases and requested datasets (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases}). The third section shows the result of the evaluated willingness of the interviewees to develop applications based on Linked Open Data provided by the university (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:adoption-potential}).

\subsection{Methodology}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:methodology}
Since the idea of Linked Open Data as well as the idea of applying it to the domain of universities is around for a while now (e.g. Linked Universities, 2011), the first step was to discover Linked Open Data initiatives of universities that have already been started and case studies that have already been conducted. A brief description of the results can be seen in section \ref{related-work}. The discovered case studies and initiatives were analysed and two common use cases, which may be the most interesting ones from the point of a student, were extracted; a map of places of interest (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:map}) and a resource list management application (see \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:rlm}). 

Afterwards the case study was designed and semi-structured interviews were planned to answer the research questions of the case study. Both extracted use cases were part of the interviews; on the one hand to give the interviewees an idea what Linked Open Data can be used for and on the other hand to evaluate the acceptance and doubts regarding these use cases. Potential interviewees were collected by suggestions of prior interviewees and persons that are quite familiar with the domain of the university. In summary, five interviews were conducted and at the time of the conduction all interviewees were \textit{students} or persons affiliated with \textit{student affairs}. A more detailed description of the interviewees can be found in section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:interviewees}. The design of the interview is further discussed in the following section.

\subsubsection{Interview design}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:interview-design}
In order to answer the given research questions of the case study \textbf{five} semi-structured interviews were conducted. In a semi-structured interview the questions are planned in advance, but they are not asked in the same order as they are listed. A semi-structured interview let researchers have their freedom to decide, which question to ask next in dependence on the development of the conversation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews allow for improvisation and exploration of the
studied objects \cite{runeson_guidelines_2008}. This is exactly why a semi-structured approach was used, because in this case study the participant of the interview shall have the freedom to express his/her ideas without being constrained by a fixed order of planned questions. In order to have a guideline for the interviews, a questionnaire was created, which can be seen in the appendix (see \ref{questionaire}). The questionnaire is composed of five parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An introduction to the research team.
	\item General questions about the background of the interviewee including for example the level of expertise in the field of Linked Open Data.
	\item An introduction to Linked Open Data by using a simple example.   
	\item Proposal of both extracted use cases and open question about the acceptance and opinion regarding these use cases.
	\item Open questions to gather ideas about potential use cases and datasets for which a more open access is requested. In addition, open questions about the willingness to develop applications based on LOD provided by the university.
\end{enumerate}

The list represents in which order the parts of the questionnaire were addressed during the interview, but as mentioned earlier due to the nature of semi-structured interviews there is no need for keeping this order. First, the research team was introduced to the interviewee as well as the objective. Afterwards, the moderator asked the interviewee about their background. Due to the question about the level of expertise in the field of Linked Open Data, the moderator was able to decide whether an introduction to Linked Open Data is required or not. The maybe skipped introduction was followed by the last two parts, where the moderator asked open questions concerning the research goals of the case study. 

The interviews were conducted in teams of two researchers. One researcher, who was the moderator and one, who had the task to collect data by writing valuable contributions onto a logging sheet. This approach was chosen, because the attempt to moderate a interview and to simultaneously log it may lead to the lose of valuable contributions or a frequently interrupted conversation. An alternative is the recording of the conversation, but in this case the single researcher has to spend more time (in worst case two times more) to extract important contributions from the conversation and the interviewee may not be in favour of it. On the other hand no second researcher, who is familiar with the study, is required and the recording can be used for later analysis. Nevertheless the first approach was used.

\subsection{Background of interviewees}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:interviewees}
At the beginning of the interviews, the five participants had to answer some questions about their background. They had to describe their daily work tasks and responsibilities at the university. Furthermore, the interviewees had to estimate their level of expertise in the field of Information \& Communication Technologies and in the field of Linked Open Data. Table \ref{table:interviewee-background} shows the results and table \ref{table:interviews-rating scales} shows the used rating scales.\\

\subsection{Use cases and needs}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases}


\subsubsection{Map of places of interest}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:map}

\begin{figure}[t]
\label{fig:ush-map-app}
\centering \includegraphics*[width=0.75\columnwidth]{images/maps-app/southampton_map_app.png}
\caption{Map application of the University of Southampton}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Description:}
The facilities of the Vienna University of Technology are spread over a wide area (mostly in the fourth district of Vienna) and especially, when you are new to the campus regardless of whether you are a student, an employee or a visitor, a map application that
shows the location of places of interest and make it possible to search them may save some time and reduce annoyance. Not only to find them in the first place, but also for finding free learning or computer rooms as well as for the social life beyond the university; finding cafés or restaurants that are nearby.

The University of Southampton has developed a map application\footnote{\url{http://maps.southampton.ac.uk/}} based on their Linked Open Data initiative (see figure \ref{fig:ush-map-app}). This map application provides a detailed view of the location of the buildings and the internal structure with the ability to switch floors. The application makes it possible for the user to get more detailed information like where single rooms or printers are located. Especially, the computer rooms are highlighted and the opening hours as well as an estimated occupancy rate are displayed per request. This sort of application use case of Linked Open Data seem to be very popular and is also implemented among others at the University of Münster\footnote{\url{http://app.uni-muenster.de/Karte/}} and Oxford University\footnote{\url{https://data.ox.ac.uk/explore/science-area/}}.

The Vienna University of Technology has already published the location of the lecture rooms, seminar rooms and plans of the internal structure of the buildings in an open way, but not in a format, where the content can be interpreted by machines. Additional to this, there are other sources with valuable information for such a map. TUbarrierfrei manages knowledge about the accessibility of buildings and certain rooms, Fachschaft (student representatives) provides information about learning rooms and ZID about computer rooms. The project called LinkedGeoData\footnote{\url{http://linkedgeodata.org/About}} provides geographical information (e.g. cafés, restaurants and super markets that are nearby) as Linked Open Data. At the time of writing, these datasets cannot be interlinked and presented to the user in a map a<pplication.

\paragraph{Results:}
All interviewees responded positively to this proposed application use case and would use such an application. Interviewee \textit{\textbf{E}} would like to have an overview of all scheduled events(exams, lectures, exercises) that take place in a certain room at a particular date. This idea corresponds to the demand of all other interviewees to find free rooms for particular tasks. \textit{\textbf{A}} and \textit{\textbf{D}} would like to have a service, where all free rooms that can potentially be used for meet-ups and learning like free lecture rooms are indicated on such a map. \textit{\textbf{B}} and \textit{\textbf{C}} would like to have a service to simplify the finding of free seminar rooms and rooms in general that can be used by tutors to mentor their students. Regarding the provision of information about the accessibility in such a map, \textit{\textbf{B}} mentioned that real-time data about disfunctional elevators may be quite useful. \textit{\textbf{C}} would also like to have an overview of the location of institutes. This idea corresponds to the science area application of the Oxford University\footnote{\url{https://data.ox.ac.uk/explore/science-area/}}. \textit{\textbf{E}} wanted to make the note that such a map application shall also work offline.

\paragraph{Challenges:}
The information required for such an application is separated over different data sources including diverging data owners, but this phenomena is not unique for this use case and challenges as well as an approach to overcome this is further discussed in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges}.

\subsubsection{Resource management list}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:rlm}

\paragraph{Description:}
The Vienna University of Technology consists of eight faculties, which cover the classical areas of natural and technical science and overall, there are 52 different institutes; each of them with further branches and a range of courses. TISS is the central source for actual course information over the WWW, but some of these courses have their own information system (mostly simple websites or e-learning platforms), where special details of the course are published like for example the slides of the lectures, the bibliography of learning resources, dates of events (lectures, exams, ...) or exercise sheets.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering \includegraphics*[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/rlm-tools/aber-explore-1.png}
\caption{Reading list for 'Exploring the International 1', Aberystwyth University}
\label{fig:rlm-aber-1}
\end{figure}

When a student wants to get an overview of the suggested resources (books, journal articles, web pages and other forms of media) for attainig the learning goals of the course, the student may have to scan web pages and lecture slides for collecting them. Furthermore the student has to search for a supplier for each resource that is not freely accessible over the WWW, like most books and journals. Resource lists management tools try to simplify this procedure. \begin{quote}On the subject of the user experience for the student, RLM tools have often been no more than electronic replicas of the paper based list. There has traditionally been little attempt to allow students to annotate items with regard to their intended use, or interact with content. Students could not feedback whether they have found items useful in attaining their learning goals, or add personal study notes. There has been no facility to allow the students themselves to form new collections or bibliographies of resources for a particular essay or group exercise.\cite{clarke_resource_2009}\end{quote} Resource lists, that are simply exposed on web pages or in lecture slides, are not a very convenient approach from the students perspective. Resource lists management tools can take Linked Open Data principles into consideration and link the resources to the suppliers (and especially to the local academic library, if possible). The students can give feedback to a resource list of the lecturer and create their own resource lists, which can on their part be rated by other students. Students can also comment respectively mark helpful sections of resources.

\paragraph{Results:}
\textit{\textbf{B}} and \textit{\textbf{C}} were quite sceptical about this use case and their concerns are further discussed in the challenge section. \textit{\textbf{A}}, \textit{\textbf{D}} and \textit{\textbf{E}} would like to have such an application.\textit{\textbf{E}} said, ''\textit{Yes. It is a pain to stay up-to-date on organizational lecture information, which is often distributed over TISS\footnote{central information system of the Vienna University of Technology}, TUWEL\footnote{e-learning platform, a customization of moodle}, the institutute homepage, etc.} ...''. This comment goes beyond this use case and concerns organizational information in general. Such a resource list management tool could be part of a broader set of services that simplify the organizational burden of students. \textit{\textbf{D}} mentioned that (s)he was multiple times on the edge to send explored useful resources that helped him/her a lot to attain the learning goals of the course per email to the lecturer. \textit{\textbf{D}} also suggested a ranking like on stackoverflow\footnote{\url{http://stackoverflow.com/}}, where contributions can be liked or disliked and in consequence helpful contributions are usually at the top. \textit{\textbf{E}} suggested to make it possible to link to useful contributions in the Informatikforum\footnote{internet forum for students of informatics} and experience reports on VOWI\footnote{a wiki, where students share experience and knowledge about courses}.

\paragraph{Challenges:}
\textit{\textbf{B}} and \textit{\textbf{C}} mentioned that the additional administrative burden for course teams like keeping the list up-to-date may diminish the willingness of using such an application.\textit{\textbf{B}} pointed out, that the use of the e-learning platform TUWEL is also not accepted throughout all course teams. While the contribution of the course team would be quite valuable, the resource list management tool could allow the students to create resource lists completely on their own. However, this approach may cause situations where solutions to exercises are contributed as well as spam, if the course team is not into it. Same as with the map application use case, the information required for such an application is separated over different data sources including diverging data owners. Challenges as well as an approach to overcome this is further discussed in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges}.

\subsubsection{Explored use cases}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:explored}
One essential part of the interview was the exploration of the interviewee's ideas regarding needful use cases and datasets for which a more open access is requested. This section represents the results.

\paragraph{Course calendar:} As mentioned earlier and also by some interviewees, the organizational information for courses may be separated over multiple sources. There is the central information system TISS, where basic information for mostly all courses is exposed. Especially for courses with exercises, also the e-learning platform TUWEL is often used simultaneously, where all the deadlines for the exercises are exposed and sometime more detailed information about the lecture times. And yet other courses have their own platform or own simple web pages, where more detailed organizational information is provided. In order to get an overview of all dates, a student has to collect this information manually, which is not a convenient approach. On the one hand this procedure is quite time-consuming and on the other hand prone to failures. For \textit{\textbf{D}} the calendar shall have following functions.

\begin{description}
 \item[Range of covered events:] The calendar shall not only contain the lecture times of favoured courses, but also other important events like dates of course/exercise-group/exam registrations or exercise deadlines.
 \item[Semester planning:] The calendar shall be able to detect intersections of events (e.g. the lecture time of one course intersect with the lecture time of another) and give a precise warning. 
 \item[Synchronization:] There shall be the ability to synchronize the course calendar with the own calendar.
\end{description} 

TISS already provides a calendar with the dates of all favoured courses, but the calendar is restricted to the lecture times exposed on TISS.

\paragraph{Course information:} As mentioned above, the organizational information about courses may be separated over multiple sources. Firstly, there should be a possibility to present all available organizational information about a certain course to a student. Additionally, there are also internet forums and wikis operated by students that collect information (mostly experience) about certain courses. \textit{\textbf{D}} and \textit{\textbf{E}} wanted to have the ability to interlink the course information on TISS with other sources like VOWI (wiki operated by students). \textit{\textbf{D}} also would like to have the ability to filter courses by categories. For example, when a student is interested in artificial intelligence and (s)he want to get all courses of this field. 

\paragraph{Event calendar:} Same as with course information, the information about events that are going to take place at the university are separated over different sources in dependence on which organizational unit organizes the event. \textit{\textbf{D}} would like to have a calendar for all events. It shall be possible to filter the events by categories/organizational units. This idea is similar to the event calendar of the University of Southampton\footnote{\url{http://www.events.soton.ac.uk/}}. At the moment of writing, the events are often announced to the students per email, flyers or by word-of-mouth recommendations including social networks. It is likely to oversee events in which you are potentially interested in. \textit{\textbf{D}} would also like to have an event calendar that can be synchronized with the own calendar using the mentioned filter.

\subsection{Adoption potential}
\label{lod-benefits-challenges:adoption-potential}
The interviewees were also asked about their willingness to develop applications based on Linked Open Data provided by the university. 

\textit{\textbf{A}} is willing to develop applications based on Linked Open Data, if a comprehensive documentation is provided for application developers and would in this case see a playground for other students of informatics. \textit{\textbf{A}} is a student representative and manages some valuable information for the students. \textit{\textbf{A}} pointed out that a provision of some of this information as Linked Open Data may cause a disproportionate amount of work and maintenance burden, when questioned about it, but is open to it.

Student \textit{\textbf{D}} would be willed to develop applications based on provided Linked Open Data, only if some incentives like rewards for innovative applications were provided, but could imagine that some of his/her student colleagues may develop small applications for their own joy. Student \textit{\textbf{E}} would be willed to, if (s)he has a creative idea. 

\textit{\textbf{B}} saw his/her personal interest in other areas, but could imagine that students of courses that lecture software engineering, where a practical project has to be carried out (mentioned course 'Advanced Software Engineering' at the Vienna University of Technology), may design an application based on Linked Open Data provided by the university. \textit{\textbf{C}} was principally interested in writing such an application.

Overall, the interviewees were more or less cautious regarding this question.

\section{Technical architecture and challenges}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges}

Today's universities usually have to manage a significant amount of information and additional one is produced day by day. Due to the complexity of the domain of a university, there may be multiple services that handle a particular part of the domain. For a university that commits both to science and science education, the domain includes areas like the management of an academic library or the provision of an education respectively research platform. Furthermore, larger universities tend to spread their services across several departments to serve their stakeholders and satisfy their specific requirements. This phenomena of spreading services can not only be observed at the Vienna University of Technology, but also at the Open University\footnote{\url{http://www.open.ac.uk/}} (Fouad Zablith, Mathieu d’Aquin, Stuart Brown and Liam Green-Hughes, 2011)\cite{zablith_consuming_2011}.

It is likely for such an environment to result in independent services, which encapsulate their collected information into disconnected data sources with different formats and/or data owners. As a result of this, the information that has been collected by all these multiple services can not easily be interlinked, which blocks the full potential. A simple example for such two isolated services at the Vienna University of Technology are the e-learning platform called TUWEL\footnote{\url{https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/}}, which is a customization of moodle\footnote{\url{https://moodle.org/}}, and the central information system called TISS. Both of these services provide course information and material, but they are intended for different purposes. TISS focuses mainly on administrative functionality like course or exam registrations, whereas TUWEL focuses on a broader interaction between teacher and student. Providing for example an additional functionality, which synchronizes important dates from deadlines of exercises to the time of lectures and exams with your own calendar might be quite useful, but the development is costly, due to the fact that the information is separated over this different isolated data sources and at that point not freely accessible. 

Section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal} proposes a technical architecture using a Linked Data approach to overcome this environment of data silos and to support the evolvement of a university-wide data space, which can be queried. In fact this university-wide data space can be interlinked with the LOD of other entities like DBPedia or LinkedGeoData to enrich it. Section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort} describes the stakeholder driven evolvement of a Linked Open Data effort at a university. The last section discusses the challenges (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges}).

\subsection{Linked Open Data effort at universities}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering \includegraphics*[width=1.0\columnwidth]{images/technical-architecture/lod_at_tuwien_idef0.png}
\caption{IDEF0: The evolvement of a LOD effort at a university}
\label{fig:tac-idef0}
\end{figure}

This section discusses our model (see figure \ref{fig:tac-idef0}) for describing the evolvement of a Linked Open Data effort at a university driven by the stakeholders. The model visualizes the issue on an organizational level in IDEF0 notation.

\paragraph{The evolvement of a requirement for a LOD application}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort:evolvement-app-requirement}
is driven by the needs of the \textit{stakeholders} and the current information environment at a university and around this university. The requirement for a Linked Data application is rising, when the needs of a stakeholder are not sufficiently met by the information environment. Such a rising demand for a LOD application must not only be caused by an unsatisfactory situation at the university, but also by external developments like Linked Science, Open Education or the Semantic Web in general. The evolvement of such a requirement for a LOD application leads to user requirements, which shall be met by the application, and the demand for providing university resources, which will be required for such an application, as LOD.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Stakeholders}~\\
As stated in the introduction (see \ref{introduction}), we identified students, administration employees and researchers as important \textit{stakeholders} for a Linked Open Data effort at a university.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The provision of a university resource as LOD}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort:provision-resources}
is controlled by the demand on publishing the known datasets of this resource as LOD and the given costs for the process. If the demand is low and the costs are high, the provision is pointless from an economic point of view. This process includes the \textit{transformation} of the datasets into Linked Data as well as the exposure of the transformed Linked Data in an open way. The transformation process can be tricky. Especially, if the datasets consists of information that change dynamically, it takes extra thought to keep the data fresh. Also \textit{data owners} of the datasets can diverge or be unknown in advance. An issue, which is not that obvious, is the problem of copyright licenses, if your approach is data mining on public web pages of the university. This three issues are further discussed in the section of technical challenges (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges}).

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Data owner}~\\
The owner of a dataset is the organization or person that is responsible for the dataset and manages it. The exploration of the data owner is important for transforming the dataset into Linked Open Data, because the owner can authorize access to it and has specific expertise about it. 

\item \textit{Data transformer}~\\
Dependent on the format of the dataset, the data transformer can either be a program or a semi-automatic approach, where a human prepares the dataset for a program. A complete automatic approach is possible, if the datasets are available in a machine-readable format and if the content can be interpreted (e.g. CSV, XML). Whereas a semi-automatic approach is required, if the content of the dataset cannot be interpreted (e.g. images, PDF or knowledge hidden in text) or furthermore if the dataset is not available in a machine-processable format (e.g. human expertise). Then a human has to interpret and store the result in a appropriate format so that a automatic approach is applicable. The data sources and the corresponding transformation techniques are further discussed in Section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal}.

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{The development of LOD applications}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort:dev-app}
can emerge at a university, if potential initiators see a requirement for their idea of an application (meets user requirements that are not satisfied by the current information environment) and if the datasets of the resources required for such an application have already been exposed or they are going to be exposed in near future. The evolvement of an environment, where new LOD applications are initiated, assumes incentives for the \textit{development teams}. At a university with researchers and students in the field of informatics as potential \textit{developers}, joy and acknowledgement may be an incentive, beside the monetization
of the work like through university aid, donors or advertisements. This particular issue was part of the interviews with the students and the results can be seen in section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:adoption-potential}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Application developer}~\\
The application developer has the essential expertise for building software applications that meet the predefined specifications, which are influenced by the user requirements. The developer can also be a stakeholder. Computer science researchers can for example program solutions to simplify some work tasks for themselves or the whole research community at the university. 

\item \textit{Linked Data expert}~\\
An expert, who has expertise about Linked Data and the supporting frameworks of the used programming language, is inevitable, when developing an application based on Linked Data. Whereas the idea of Linked Data is around for while now, common application developers may not be familiar with this technology to an extent that they can develop a reliable application based on it. The level of the required expertise depends on how the exposed Linked Data shall be used. If the application uses the exposed Linked Data only for querying data, the level is low and an application developer can learn it with spending some extra time. If the application itself shall use the Linked Data approach to store data (e.g. triple store) and/or do more advanced operations on Linked Data like link it with other (linked) datasets, manipulate it or reason over it, a higher level is needed and it is not done by spending some extra time. In this case inviting an expert to the development team, is a better approach.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{A LOD application use case} 
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:lod-effort:use-case}
is the interaction of users with a developed application that makes use of LOD provided by the university. The application use case is the attempt to satisfy user requirements and becomes part of the information environment at the university. The exploration of interesting use cases from the student perspective was an essential part of the conducted interviews and the results can be seen in section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases}.

\subsection{Proposal of a technical architecture}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal}

In order to overcome the environment of data silos and to support the evolvement of a university-wide data space for public resources, a technical architecture following Linked Data principles is proposed and discussed in this section. Berners-Lee suggested four principles for publishing data on the web, which can be considered as best practise. The compliance with this best practise leads to Linked Data; \enquote{the idea is that the more people follow these principles, the more their data will be usable by others.}\cite{simperl_using_2013}. The four principles stated by Berners-Lee (2006)\cite{berners-lee_linked_2006} are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use URIs as names for things
	\item Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
	\item When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF, RDFS, SPARQL)
	\item Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.
\end{enumerate}
Every thing mentioned in one or more datasets of the university shall be identified uniquely by an URI. The Audimax (main lecture hall) of the Vienna University of Technology with the room code \texttt{BAU176A} may for example be identified by \url{http://lod.tuwien.ac.at/room/BAU176A} and a visit of this HTTP location reveals all the knowledge about this room like capacity, event schedule, etc. in a machine-readable format. This can include links to the hosted events using the same approach with HTTP URIs identifying those events. In this case, the four principles would be fulfilled and a computer program can easily explore this machine-readable information following those links like a human following the links on web pages to gain further information. As mentioned above, following the principles leads to Linked Data. Linked Open Data extends Linked Data with the idea of publishing it in an open way.
\begin{quote} Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).\cite{_open_????}\end{quote}

In order to transform demanded datasets of the university into Linked Data and publish it in an open way, a system architecture is required that faces the issues of diverging data sources and data freshness.\enquote{An important architectural pattern used in system development is the multitier architecture. It logically separates the functionality of the system in a number of layers and specifies the communication between those layers.}\cite{simperl_using_2013}. The proposed architecture (see figure \ref{fig:tac-high-level-architecture}) is composed of four tiers. The first tier represents the diverging forms of \textbf{\textit{data sources}} that can occur in an information environment at a university (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:data-source}). The second tier shows the \textbf{\textit{integration}} of such data sources into a central data storage for linked data also called triple store (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:integration}). The third tier shows the \textbf{\textit{provision}} of the stored linked data (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:provision}) so that developers can implement \textbf{\textit{applications}} based on it represented in the fourth tier.  

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering \includegraphics*[width=0.9\columnwidth]{images/technical-architecture/lod_technical_architecture.png}
\caption{High level architecture for providing Linked Open Data (adapted from EUCLID {\cite{simperl_using_2013}})}
\label{fig:tac-high-level-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Data sources}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:data-source}
As mentioned earlier, the information environment of a university may consist of multiple independent services that evolved over time powered by data sources that do not met the principles of Linked Data like relational databases. In order to encourage data owners to publish their data as Linked Open Data, Berners-Lee developed the following star rating system: \cite{berners-lee_linked_2006}\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}  p{10cm}}
		$\bigstar$ & Available on the web (whatever format) but with an open licence, to be Open Data. \\
		\hline
		$\bigstar\bigstar$ & Available as machine-readable structured data (e.g. excel instead of image scan of a table)\\
		\hline
		$\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar$ & as ($\bigstar\bigstar$) plus non-proprietary format (e.g. CSV instead of excel)\\
		\hline
		$\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar$ & All the above plus, Use open standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) to identify things, so that people can point at your stuff\\
		\hline
		$\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar$ & All the above, plus: Link your data to other people’s data to provide context\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Nevertheless, there are techniques to integrate these diverging data sources into a five-star Linked Data environment without reconstructing legacy services and work-flows, which is described in the \textbf{\textit{integration}} tier. In this section, the different forms of data sources that may occur in the information environment of a university are listed. 

\paragraph{Not machine-readable:} Not machine-processable sources of knowledge like the expertise of a human (e.g. which rooms are in which way accessible) or not machine-readable data (e.g. images, PDF files) have to be transformed by a human into data formats that can be processed and interpreted by computers in order to be managed by the proposed technical architecture. Non machine-readable data like images or PDF files have a rating of one-star ($\bigstar$), if they are exposed on a public accessible web page. It is then considered as Open Data.

\paragraph{(Semi-)structured data:} A quick look at a data repository like \texttt{datahub.io} shows that a major part of datasets are released as CSV files or as proprietary excel files (xsl, xslx). The same phenomena can be observed at the Austrian open data portals \texttt{opendataportal.at} and \texttt{data.gv.at}. On one side it is a common way to exchange data in offices and on the other side an easy and inexpensive way to publish data. Universities are no exceptions, the Vienna University of Economics for example releases course information as CSV files on their open data portal. Data published in form of CSV files have a rating of three-stars ($\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar$), whereas released excel files have only a rating of two-stars ($\bigstar\bigstar$) due to the lacking openness of the format. RSS feeds, if used by the university, can also be a source for valuable structured information.

\paragraph{Relational databases:} \enquote{Data is often stored in a relational database, perhaps powering an important legacy application. In such cases it is generally advisable to retain the existing data management infrastructure and software, so as not to disrupt legacy applications}.\cite{heath_linked_2011} Instead the \textit{\textbf{integration tier}} shows how to integrate the data of a relational database into a Linked Data system. The data of relational databases could be presented to the application user on public web pages in a human readable or also in a structured format. The data may also be accessible by a Web API.

\paragraph{Web APIs:} Web APIs are one way to give access to particular data of a application in a structured format so that application developers on their hand can use them for their application. It is common to provide results in formats such as XML and JSON. At the Vienna University of Technology, the central information system TISS has a RESTful API, which gives access to some data like course information or the address book. Web APIs achieve a rating of $\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar$, if the API uses open and structured formats. However, this Web APIs have some limitations in the perspective of Linked Data. \begin{quote}Data returned from Web APIs typically exists as isolated fragments, lacking reliable onward links signposting the way to related data. Therefore, while Web APIs make data accessible on the Web, they do not place it truly in the Web, making it linkable and therefore discoverable.\cite{heath_linked_2011} \end{quote} Nevertheless, Web APIs are a good starting point and the \textit{\textbf{integration tier}} shows how to integrate data of Web APIs into a Linked Data system using wrappers.

\paragraph{Moodle:} \enquote{Moodle is an open-source e-learning application, written in PHP and widely used by teachers all over the world}.\cite{lukichev_empowering_????} Such an application is the source of a lot of unstructured data concerning course information and learning materials, but the information is whether public accessible nor machine-readable. Lukichev et. al. \cite{lukichev_empowering_????} described preliminary ideas for empowering the e-learning platform Moodle with rules and semantics, providing tutors a useful application for flexible course management and reporting. At the moment of writing Moodle does not have a plugin providing this capability. However, Holtham et. al. outline the development of a next-generation learning environment based on semantic web-based technologies and pedagogies of the mid-21st century in a position paper for 2020.\cite{holtham_moodle_2012}

\paragraph{MediaWiki:} \enquote{Wikis have become popular tools for collaboration on the web and many vibrant online communities employ wikis to exchange knowledge} \cite{krotzsch_semantic_2006} like students at universities. At the Vienna University of Technology the student representatives employed a Mediawiki for sharing experience and other knowledge about courses as well as about the university itself. Mediawiki is a widely-used open-source wiki written in PHP, originally for use on Wikipedia. The knowledge is usually exchanged in form of plain text and uploaded files like images, PDF files or similar multimedia content, so that it is not machine-readable. Semantic MediaWiki\footnote{\url{https://semantic-mediawiki.org/}} \enquote{is a semantically enhanced wiki engine that enables users to annotate the wiki’s contents with explicit, machine-readable information}.\cite{krotzsch_semantic_2006} This extension can also be installed for already running MediaWikis. It supports semantically enriched wiki pages and provides a Web API for gathering the machine-readable information. 

\paragraph{Content Management Systems:} Content Management Systems (CMS) are like wikis popular tools for publishing knowledge on the web; \enquote{common used for blogging to express personal or professional views on the world or on observed items that may be of interest to others.}\cite{bojars_using_2006} CMSs are not only used for blogging, but also for more general purposes. The Vienna University of Technology has set up a Typo3\footnote{\url{https://typo3.org/}} CMS to serve valuable information about the university and about some of it’s organizational units (e.g. interest group for accessibility). The same as with MediaWikis, the content published by these CMSs is valuable, but often not machine-readable. Particular CMSs provide modules that simplify the annotation of CMS’s content with explicit, machine-readable information. Drupal\footnote{\url{https://drupal.org/}} does for example automatically provide meta-data (title, author, topic, etc.) about the published content. In this case, the proposed \textbf{\textit{integration tier}} could integrate those meta-data into the system.

\paragraph{Semantically enriched web pages:} Solutions like annotating content published by Content Management Systems and MediaWikis lead to semantically enriched web pages. RDFa is often used alongside microdata and mircroformats. RDFa is a extension to HTML5 that makes it possible to annotate human-readable information contained in HTML5 pages to provide semantics for machines. \enquote{RDFa is popular in contexts where data publishers are able to modify HTML templates but have relatively little additional control over the publishing infrastructure} \cite{heath_linked_2011}. A snippet of a HTML page using RDFa is shown in the following, where the fact that Heinz Zemanek is an alumni of the Vienna University of Technology is stated.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny, language=html, frame=single] 
<div vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="CollegeOrUniversity">
  <span property="name">Vienna University of Technology</span>
  <link property="sameAs"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_University_of_Technology"/>
  <div property="alumni" typeof="OrganizationRole">
    <div property="alumni" typeof="Person">
      <span property="name">Heinz Zemanek</span>
      <link property="sameAs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Zemanek"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
\end{lstlisting}
Microdata and microformats work in a similar way. Not only CMSs emplyoed by the university, also course teams who are employing own information systems or student representative`s websites could  make use of this technique. It is a convenient way for the data owner to serve data in a human- and machine-readable format. The \textbf{\textit{integration tier}} shows how this data can be extracted and integrated into the system.

\paragraph{Linked Open Data:} The Linked Open Data cloud (see figure \ref{fig:lod-cloud-diagram}) visualizes datasets of various domains that have been published in Linked Data format (2014)\cite{_linking_????}. Berners-Lee emphasizes in his principles for publishing Linked Data that the data shall be interlinked with external linked data to give context. Hence, the gathering of particular linked datasets must also be considered by the technical architecture for the purpose of interlinking. The ways in which linked data is exposed can diverge. It can be a SPARQL endpoint (see \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:provision}), a Web API, or a RDF dump possibly published on a repository like \texttt{datahub.io}. For example, the European Library\footnote{\url{http://theeuropeanlibrary.org}} manages the collections of national libraries as well as research libraries of Europe and exports them regularly into a single RDF file (dump). The academic library of the university could interlink items of it`s own collection with the matching items of the European Library project. As a result, the academic library enriches it`s own knowledge about this item with the collected knowledge of the European Library project (e.g. contributors).

\subsubsection{Integration}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:integration}
The \textit{\textbf{data source tier}} represents diverging data sources, which may be part of the information environment of a university. The \textit{\textbf{integration tier}} shows how to integrate the demanded and available datasets of those data sources into the system. The integration process consists of multiple steps, which are described in the following.

\paragraph{Data acquisition} is the first step of the integration process and is required for acquiring the data that shall be integrated into the system. According to Simperl et.al.\cite{simperl_using_2013}\cite{heath_linked_2011} there are number of ways, in which the data consumed and integrated within the system may be accessed. The approach used for this proposed architecture is the \textit{crawling pattern}, where the data is acquired in advance and afterwards the acquired data is integrated and cleansed. The disadvantage of this pattern is that the data will be replicated and might not be up to date. Nevertheless, \enquote{the crawling pattern is suitable for implementing applications on top of an open, growing set of sources}\cite{heath_linked_2011}, which is beneficial for systems that shall integrate public resources of a university. An alternative approach is the \textit{On-The-Fly Dereferencing pattern}, \enquote{where the URIs are dereferenced at the moment that the system requires the data}; no local storage is needed. The advantage is up-to-date data, but the performance may be very slow in dependence of how costly gathering and transforming the demanded data is.

%\subparagraph{Physical wrapper:}

%\subparagraph{Crawling for RDFa and microdata:}

%\subparagraph{Linked Data wrapper:}


\paragraph{Vocabulary mapping} is the second step of the integration process. In this step the acquired data is translated into the system`s target schema (in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:vocabulary} a collection of vocabularies that may be of interest for a university`s domain is listed). The translation is definitely necessary for acquired data that has not already be transformed into Linked Data. For the proposed technical architecture, this would be the case for (semi-)structured datasets like CSV or XML. In the following, some tools are listed for transforming (semi-)structured datasets into Linked Data.

\begin{description}
 	\item[\small From tables and spreadsheets:] $ $
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item \textbf{Open Refine}\footnote{\url{http://openrefine.org/}} is a graphical tool for semi-automatically transforming and cleaning messy data including among others CSV, XML and JSON. A RDF Extension~\footnote{\url{http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/grefine-rdf-extension/}} can be used to map the data to one`s vocabulary and to export the result into a RDF file.
 		\item \texttt{Any23}~\footnote{\url{http://lab.linkeddata.deri.ie/2010/grefine-rdf-extension/}} or  \texttt{csv2rdf4lod} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/timrdf/csv2rdf4lod-automation/wiki}} are Java APIs that can be used for simple transformations from CSV into RDF.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\small From RSS and XML:] $ $
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A common used approach to transform XML into other representations is \texttt{XSLT}. W3C recommends the \texttt{GRDDL}~\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/}} language for transforming XML into RDF. RSS feeds use a standard XML file format, so the same tools can be applied to it.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\small From relational databases]  that can be accessed directly by the system\textbf{:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{R2RML} is a W3C recommandation for mapping relational databases to linked data, which can be used in two ways. First, the data can be transformed into a RDF dump by using a specified R2RML mapping. Afterwards, the RDF dump can be integrated. Secondly, SPARQL queries could be translated on-the-fly into relational queries, which is not suitable for the proposed architecture.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\small From other formats:] $ $
	\begin{itemize}
		\item W3C made a document available named \texttt{ConverterToRdf}\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf}} in which tools for transforming several formats into RDF are exposed.
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

Furthermore, different Linked Data sources often use different vocabularies to represent data about the same type of entity.\cite{berners-lee_fractal_2008} In this case a vocabulary mapping may also be necessary in order to give the \textit{\textbf{applications}} a integrated view of the stored linked data. 

\paragraph{Interlinking} is the third step of the integration process. As mentioned earlier, a Linked Data principle is the interlinking with other linked data to give context. Interlinking entities of the local triple store with matching entities of other datasets enriches the knowledge about these entities by giving the end user the ability to explore. \texttt{Silk} \footnote{\url{http://silkframework.org/}} is a Java framework that supports the interlinking of datasets providing an own specification language (SILK-LSL). It can handle different data sources like SPARQL endpoints and RDF dumps to interlink with. With \texttt{Silk}`s workbench the linking can be configured graphically.

\paragraph{Cleansing} is the fourth step of the integration process. In this step the data that has been transformed and maybe interlinked with other datasets in the previous steps is cleaned up before it is stored (e.g. removal of ambiguities).

\paragraph{Storing} is the final step in which the linked data is stored in a central triple store. There are a lot of implementations of such a triple store, like 
\texttt{Sesame}~\footnote{\url{http://rdf4j.org/}}, 
\texttt{Jena TDB}~\footnote{\url{http://openjena.org/TDB/}},
\texttt{Virtuoso Universal Server}~\footnote{\url{http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/}},
\texttt{4Store}~\footnote{\url{http://4store.org/}} or 
\texttt{SwiftOWLIM}~\footnote{\url{http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/}}. The LUCERO project settled for the \texttt{SwiftOWLIM}, because it is ``\textit{free, scalable and efficient, and includes limited reasoning capabilities}''~\cite{daquin_lucero_2010-1}.

\subsubsection{Provision}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:provision}
In the \textit{\textbf{integration tier}} the demanded and available datasets were integrated into a local triple store. The \textit{\textbf{provision tier}} gives now an overview of the different ways to grant the end user access to the linked data stored in the local triple store.

\paragraph{SPARQL endpoint:} SPARQL is a language that enables the querying of a RDF dataset or in this case the whole triple store. A SPARQL endpoint is a web service that can process SPARQL requests and returns the corresponding results. The advantage of SPARQL endpoints is that the end user can flexibly request a particular subset of the data stored in the local triple store.

\paragraph{RESTful API:} \enquote{RESTful APIs are a programming interface implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) to allow actions on Web resources}.\cite{hyland_linked_????}
In order to not violate the principles of LOD the API must be open. Linked data API\footnote{\url{http://www.epimorphics.com/web/projects/linked-data-api}} can be used to provide a RESTful interface to the end user making also SPARQL requests possible, so that the end user does not have to forgo their flexibility.

\paragraph{CMS enriched with RDFa:} The previous mentioned techniques for exposing stored linked data are not suitable for human readers. They are targeting the application developer as end user. However,  \textit{resolvable URIs} are an approach to provide knowledge about an entity contained in the triple store by visiting it`s unique identifier (HTTP URI). One advantage is the possibility of applying \textit{content negotiation}. This means, that the end user can specify the desired format of the response by modifying the \texttt{Accept} entry of the request's header (machine-readable: \texttt{application/rdf+xml}, human-readable: \texttt{text/html}); \texttt{text/html} is the default entry for web browsers.

In general, the human-readable response will be a web page, which leads to a further advantage. These web pages on their side can be annotated using RDFa to provide semantics for machines. The reason why it can be useful to do so meanwhile the machine-readable knowledge could simply be requested by using \textit{content negotiation} is the ability of nowadays search engines to extract the knowledge provided by RDFa or mircrodata. \enquote{The embedded data is crawled together with the HTML pages by search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, which use the data to enrich their search results}\cite{bizer_deployment_2013}. Schema.org\footnote{\url{http://schema.org/}} is a movement of major search engines to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. The idea is to improve the search experience for users.

Whereas \textit{resolvable URIs} are a good approach to serve knowledge in a human- and machine-readable format, it can not be used to query the stored linked data. Which is why one of the previous mentioned techniques (SPARQL endpoint or RESTful API) must be employed simultaneously to provide this ability. A service that uses \textit{resolvable URIs} and \textit{content negotiation} in combination with a SPARQL endpoint is DBPedia. DBPedia also annotates the knowledge published on a web page using RDFa (see f.e. \url{http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna_University_of_Technology}).

\subsubsection{Vocabulary}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:vocabulary}
Vocabularies model concepts of a knowledge domain and the relationships between them, which can be used to make datasets of this domain self-descriptive. This paper deals with the domain of a university as knowledge domain and as mentioned earlier, it is quite complex. Therefore, this section focuses on well-known vocabularies that describe high-level concepts of the educational side of a university, because this is the area students are most concerned about. There may be the need to develop an own vocabulary in order to model concepts of a university that are specific to it, but it should be avoided to define an own vocabulary from scratch. On the contrary, terms and concepts modelled by well-know vocabularies shall be reused if possible. Consequently, applications can use the resulting linked data more easily in combination with linked data exposed by others, because the data shares matching terms and concepts.

\begin{description}
	\item[Bowlogna Ontology]\footnote{\url{http://diuf.unifr.ch/main/xi/bowlogna}} is a schema proposed by Demartini et.al.~\cite{demartini_bowlogna_2013} that is aimed at European universities involved in the Bologna Reform and includes terms and concepts of this reform like for example ECTS, courses, modules, curricula and the relationship between them.
	\item[Metadata for Learning Opportunities] (MLO) is a schema that aims to advertise learning opportunities like courses of a university. In comparison to the \texttt{Bowlogna Ontology}, \texttt{MLO} does not provide concepts for modules and curricula, but focuses on describing the course so that potential attendees get an idea of it. \enquote{Mappings between \texttt{Bowlogna Ontology} and \texttt{MLO} are naturally possible}~\cite{demartini_bowlogna_2013}.
	
	\item[Learning Resource Metadata initiative]\footnote{\url{http://lrmi.dublincore.net/}} is a schema that aims to provide a collection of properties for describing educational resources. This schema was adapted by \texttt{Schema.org}, which leads to the advantage that linked data about educational resources marked up with this schema is recognised by major search engines. It is a suitable high-level schema for the \textit{Resource List Management Tool} use case proposed in section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:rlm}.
	
	\item[Resource List Ontology]\footnote{\url{http://vocab.org/resourcelist/schema}} is a schema that aims to describe collections of resources, which usually refer to bibo:Documents (bibo \dots{Bibliography Ontology\footnote{\url{http://bibliontology.com/bibo/}}}). This is as the previous one a suitable schema for the \textit{Resource List Management Tool} use case proposed in section \ref{lod-benefits-challenges:explored-needs-usecases:rlm}. It is actually used by Talis Aspire (an resource list management service) in combination with \texttt{Aiiso}.
	
	\item[Academic Institution Internal Structure Ontology] (AIISO) is a schema that aims to describe the internal organizational structure of an academic institution, but does not offer a comprehensive set of properties to describe courses in comparison to \texttt{Bowlogna Ontology} and \texttt{MLO}. \texttt{AIISO-Roles}\footnote{\url{http://vocab.org/aiiso-roles/schema}}, \texttt{FOAF}\footnote{\url{http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/}} (\dots{schema aimed to describe people and their social networks}) and \texttt{Participation}\footnote{\url{http://vocab.org/participation/schema}}(\dots{schema aimed to describe the role of people within groups}) can be used in partnership with \texttt{AIISO} to describe the role of people within an academic institution.
\end{description}

The \textit{Linked Open Vocabularies} repository\footnote{\url{http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/}} of the \textit{Open Knowledge Foundation} manages a number of vocabularies and can be used to find popular vocabularies that model required concepts and terms.

\subsection{Challenges}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges}
In the previous sections a system architecture to expose demanded public resources of a university was discussed as well as use cases based on such Linked Open Data. This section discusses briefly the most important issues that system designer and project manager has to deal with when starting a Linked Open Data effort at a university. At a university the data quality issue might not be too relevant, because the data is integrated from a set of know sources. \enquote{In cases where the system integrate data from the open Web, data quality assessment becomes crucial}\cite{heath_linked_2011}. However, in the following the issue of data freshness among others is raised.

\paragraph{Data ownership:}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges:data-ownership}
As mentioned earlier, larger universities tend to spread their services across several departments to serve their stakeholders and satisfy their specific requirements. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the domain of a university, there may be multiple services that handle a particular part of the domain. It is likely for such an environment to result in independent services with diverging data owners. In order to establish a university-wide linked data space for demanded public resources the data owner has to be explored. The data owner is the person or organization who manages the data and therefore has the right to grant access to it or to expose it. On the one hand the exploration of the data owner is important to clarify the legal situation and to get expertise about the data source. On the other hand it is important to have an agreement with the data owner for a certain amount of time in advance to guarantee that effort taken by application developers and the system designers was not useless. A trustful agreement with the data owner may be an  additional incentive for teams to develop applications based on data of this data owner.

\paragraph{Data licenses}
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges:license}
This topic is connected to the previous one and addresses the issue of legal concerns regarding the reuse of data. A common assumption is that data and content published on the Web can be reused at will, but a missing license statement does not automatically grant the data consumer the right to reuse the data. This is important to know, if the system employed at the university shall integrate machine-readable data from public web sites of the university into it`s triple store; as mentioned in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:integration}, a crawler could extract RDFa and microdata from web pages. For this reason it is advisable to contact the owner of the web site, where the license statement is missing, in order to integrate the machine-readable data of it. 

Conversely, if the university employs a system that exposes public resources as Open Data or Linked Open Data on the Web it should include explicit license statements. The absence of such a license statement including the terms under which the exposed data about public resources can be reused by application developers may lead to a situation where developers hesitate to resuse the data as well as limited erffort may be taken to build application based on data whose terms of reuse are unclear. Licenses like Copyright or Creative Commons\footnote{\url{https://creativecommons.org/}} cannot be applied to exposed linked data due to the fact that data is not a creative work and therefore not protectable by these license models; a defensiable legal basis is missing. However, the content of data can be protected by these licenses.\cite{miller_open_2008} Nevertheless, some license models evolved over time to fill this gap; Public Domain Dedication and License\footnote{\url{http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/}} (PDDL), Attribution License\footnote{\url{http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/}} (ODC-By) and Open Database License\footnote{\url{http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/}} (ODbL) are common.

\paragraph{Data freshness:} 
\label{technical-architecture-challenges:challenges:data-freshness}
As described in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:data-source}  diverging sources of data may occur in the information environment of a university. A system exposing demanded datasets from those data sources as Linked Open Data has to deal with the issue of data freshness in dependence of how dynamic the data is. In section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:integration} two approaches are discussed; the \textit{crawling pattern}, which acquires data in advance and integrates it into the central triple store, and the \textit{On-The-Fly Dereferencing pattern}, which accesses and transforms the data, when it is requested. The proposed architecture is using the \textit{crawling pattern} and as a result of this the data might not be up-to-date, when it is requested by an application; which is why the integration process must be repeated after some time to keep the data fresh. Therefore the system designer has to find a time interval that satisfies the needs of the application developers regarding data freshness and performance, which may be impacted in case of a high update frequency. Dynamic data sources are for example datasets concerning a collection of events at a particular date, which might change over time, whereas a dataset concerning the geospatial information about facilities  might be more or less static. The system designer does not only has to keep the dynamics of data sources in mind, but also the complexity of the re-integration process (update) for particular data sources. This is an issue, especially for systems that are not aware of the history of the acquired data. Simple RDF dumps are an example, where the system has to explore the changes that has been happened since the last integration of this dump. In case of the \textit{On-The-Fly Dereferencing pattern}, the system designer does not have to face the issue of data freshness, but as a result the performance may be slow, because the data is transformed into Linked Data, when it is requested.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

The idea of Linked Open Data as well as the idea of applying it to the domain of universities (Linked Universities, 2011) is around for a while now and some effort has been taken to develop best practises and use cases for Linked Open Data in the context of universities. This paper was aimed to explore this best practises and to discover benefits, challenges and use cases from the point of a student. In more detail, the goals of this paper has been broke down into the following four research questions. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{RQ1: What are best practices regarding the applicability of Linked Open Data in university settings?}
	\item \textit{RQ2: What are the major benefits and challenges for students if certain university resources are published as Linked Open Data and which needful use cases can result out of this from the perspective of the students?}
	\item \textit{RQ3: What are major challenges for the implementation of a Linked Open Data solution?}
	\item \textit{RQ4: How would a prototypical implementation of a publication framework based on Linked Open Data look like?}
\end{itemize}

In the following each research question is addressed.

\paragraph{Research question 1:} A movement of European universities named 'Linked Universities' aims to provide help and knowledge for other universities that wish to expose their public university resources as Linked Data. The Open University, which is one of the forerunner in this regard, gave insights into their ideas and approaches regarding Linked Data at universities with the LUCERO project. Together with other active universities like the University of Southampton and University of Münster applications based on public university resources that has been exposed as Linked Data were developed and represent a show case for possible usages of Linked Data at universities. Resource List Management and Map applications become part of the case study that was conducted to answer the next two research questions. Some years later, the LinkedUp project emerged, which is funded by the European Commission aimed at pushing forward the exploitation and adoption of Linked Open Data in educational organizations and institutions. 

The conclusion is that using Linked Open Data is a promising way of enhancing and harmonizing processes at universities. In particular, these achievements have let to several contributions. One major contribution was the creation of ontologies (e.g. TEACH) and tools (e.g. Triplify) applicable in general university settings. 
Hence, a general guideline should be using already existing ontologies and tools instead of creating new ones which cover similar concepts and domains.

\paragraph{Research question 2:} In order to answer this research question a case study was conducted with \textit{five} participants to explore new beneficial use cases and to evaluate known ones from the point of students. The willingness of the students to develop applications based on Linked Open Data exposed by the university was also evaluated.

The first known use case from other universities that was proposed to the students was a map application of the campus, which resulted in a positive response of the students. They had like to use such an application and all  of them expressed the demand for finding free rooms for particular tasks; one one side to find free lecture rooms for learning and other side to find free rooms for tutors to mentor their students. But not only students had like to use such an application, also administration staff responeded positively \cite{gamerith_linked_2016}. The Vienna University of Technology exposes information about the facilities and the schedule of rooms on the Web, but not in a machine-readable way. However, with some effort this information can also be served in a machine-readable format and may lead to the development of such a highly demanded map application.

The second known use case from other universities that was proposed to the students was a resource list management application, which resulted in mixed responses. Some has been sceptical about this use case, because the additional administrative burden for course teams like keeping the list up-to-date may diminish the willingness of using such an application; whereas others responded positively. In order to make this use case possible, the course information has to be published in machine-readable format and the course teams have to be convinced to use such an application to share lists of learning resources. It would also be beneficial, if the academic library would provide meta-data about the accessible literature as Linked Open Data.

In general, the students has been unsatisfied with the way how organizational information is shared with them. Which is why the proposed use cases of the students were concerned with this issue. A proposed use case was a course calendar that manages all course events not only lecture times as well as an event calendar that give the user an overview of all planned events of university organizations. Furthermore, a use case that provides course information from different sources including VOWI (wiki employed by students) and internet forums was proposed.

Final, the willingness of the students to develop own applications based on Linked Data exposed by the university was evaluated. Overall, the interviewees were more or less cautious regarding this question, but most of them were willed to. One student mentioned that (s)he is willed to if the university provide some incentives. This incentive may not only be aid for innovative applications, but also to allow students to build applications based on university Linked Open Data as practical project in courses, where the have to be carried out. Due to the fact that informatics is one of the science fields taught by the TU Vienna, there are some course where this approach can applied; Advanced Software Engineering, Introduction to Semantic Web, SAIKS and SENIC projects. The students showed that they are not completely satisfied with the information environment of the university and have also some ideas to change this.

\paragraph{Research question 3:} One major issue for implementing a system that exposes public resources of the university as Linked Open Data is \textbf{\textit{data ownership}}. There may be diverging data owners, because there might be independent services at the university that handle a particular part of the domain. At larger universities they may also spread their services across several departments. Consequently, to expose a public resource of a university as Linked Open Data the data owners may have to be explored. A further minor challenge are \textbf{\textit{data licenses}}. In order to integrate machine-readable data from public web sites of the university it is advisable to also contact the owner if the license statement is missing. Conversely, the university has to include license agreements for each exposed linked data. A major challenge is \textbf{\textit{data freshness}}, especially for the pattern used by the proposed architecture of this paper. The system designer has to choose the update intervals thoughtfully to satisfy the needs of the application developer regarding performance and data freshness. \textit{\textbf{Data quality}} assessments should be kept in mind, if data exposed on the Web is integrated into the system.

\paragraph{Research question 4:} The evolvement of a Linked Open Data effort at a university depends on the current information environment at the university and the demand of stakeholders like students for applications based on Linked Open Data. This results in a demand for exposing public university resources that are required by such applications as Linked Open Data. The technical architecture proposed in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal} focuses on this part of the publication framework. The information environments may consist of diverging data source with different formats and data owners. The technical architecture has to face this diverging data sources and has to provide an interface to integrate them. The proposed system uses a \textit{crawling pattern}, so the data is acquired and integrated into a central triple store in advance. An alternative approach is the \textit{On-The-Fly-Referencing pattern}, where the data is accessed and transformed, when the data is requested; this can lead to scalability issues.\cite{heath_linked_2011} There are different ways to grant the end user access to the data stored in the triple store. The most convenient way for both the human reader and the application might be a Content Management System enriched with RDFa like described in section \ref{technical-architecture-challenges:proposal:provision} in combination with a SPARQL endpoint like on DBPedia. A disadvantage is the higher cost of development in comparison to a simple SPARQL endpoint; most common triple stores come with a SPARQL endpoint.

\section{Questionaire}
\label{questionaire}
This questionnaire is intended to gather new ideas about useful use cases and applications as well as to figure out datasets that may be interesting for publishing as Linked Open Data. The target group of this interview guideline are students, student’s representatives and interest groups. The whole interview is planned to last not more than 40 minutes.

\subsection{About me}
\label{questionaire:about-me}
At that point, where I wrote this interview guideline, this is a short description of myself. My Name is Kevin, I am a student of the Vienna University of Technology and I am attending the bachelor program Software and Information Engineering. I am working on a scientific work about Linked Open Data and the possible advantages of publishing the education related data of the university as Linked Open Data so that the datasets can easily be interlinked with other datasets to enrich them. The focus of this work are useful use cases, applications as well as potential interesting datasets from the student’s perspective.

\subsection{Introduction to Linked Open Data}
\label{questionaire:lod-intro}
In the situation, in which we are now, a lot of information/data is published on web pages in a human readable format. So if we want to search for special information, the default procedure may be the following. Let’s say, we want to get information about the learning rooms of the Vienna University of Technology and the way it can be entered accessibly. Then we will use our favourite search engine, scan web pages and follow links to gather the required pieces of information to join it and thereby answering the initial question of our interest. This information cannot be found on a single web page (e.g. Fachschaft Informatik\footnote{\url{https://fsinf.at/lernen}}(student representatives), TUbarrierefrei\footnote{\url{https://www.tuwien.ac.at/dle/barrierefrei/willkommen/}} , Wegweiser\footnote{\url{http://www.wegweiser.ac.at/tuwien/}}). For humans this procedure is no problem, but think of computers. If you want to write an application, that shall answer exactly this initial question, you may have to face a lot of problems and there may be no sufficient way to gather this information. At that point, there is generally no efficient way, that computers/machines understand natural language and furthermore interlink the information about several web pages.

And here Linked (Open) Data enters the game.\begin{quote} Linked Data describes a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. It builds upon standard Web technologies, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried
\cite{bizer_linked_2009}.\end{quote} Linked Open Data extends Linked Data with the idea of publishing the data in an open way, so that anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose.

To come back to the previous example, the information was separated over different sources. Beyond that, the information provided by this sources was only published in a human readable format. To take the idea of Linked Open Data into consideration, the information can also be provided in a structured format so that it is machine-readable. E.g. the Fachschaft Informatik  can provide the list of learning rooms as Linked Open Data and TUbarrierefrei  can share their information about the accessibility of the rooms respectively the buildings as Linked Open Data. Now an application designer can use both datasets and interlink them to answer the initial question of finding an accessible learning room. Furthermore the designer can interlink these datasets with other (external) datasets like Open Street Maps \footnote{\url{http://www.openstreetmap.org/}} or the list of computer rooms of the ZID \footnote{\url{http://www.zid.tuwien.ac.at/en/student/internet_raeume/}}. The result of this may be a map of interesting places for students, employees and visitors.

As not to hang on a single application or use case, one of the incitements of publishing the information as Linked Open Data is the hope, that there is an audience, that come up with creative ideas, of which you and I are currently not thinking about.

\subsection{Proposal of use cases}
\label{questionaire:usecases}

\subsubsection{Map of places of interest}
\label{questionaire:usecase-place-of-interest}
The buildings of the campus of the Vienna University of Technology are spread over a wide area. Especially, if you are new to the campus regardless of whether you are a student, an employee or a visitor, a map application of the places of interest would be very helpful. Not only to get stress less and punctual to lectures, meetings or conferences, also for the social life afterwards – finding cafes or restaurants that are nearby as well as computer rooms or learning rooms for using the gap time between lectures.
 
The University of Southampton has developed a map application for their campus including the location of computer rooms (see live\footnote{\url{http://maps.southampton.ac.uk/}} and figure \ref{fig:ush-map-app}) as well as the University of Münster (see live\footnote{\url{http://app.uni-muenster.de/Karte/}} or figure \ref{fig:um-map-app}). Both universities make use of their Linked Open Data projects.

The Vienna University of Technology has already published the location of the lecture rooms, seminar rooms and the plans of the buildings in an open way on Wegweiser, but not in a machine-readable format. As already mentioned in the introduction to Linked Open Data, there are different sources of interesting information regarding the campus of the university. TUbarrierfrei hosts information for the accessibility, the Fachschaft provides information about the learning rooms, the ZID about the computer rooms. The project called LinkedGeoData\footnote{\url{http://linkedgeodata.org/About}} provides geographical information (e.g. cafés, restaurants and super markets that are nearby), which has been collected by the community on OpenStreetMaps, as Linked Open Data. In the situation, in which we are now, these datasets cannot be interlinked although an application that offer this information to us in a useable way may be valuable for students and the university itself.

\subsubsection{Course information / Resource management}
\label{questionaire:usecase-course-rml}
The Vienna University of Technology consists of eight faculties, which cover the classical areas of natural and technical science and overall, there are 52 different institutes - each of them with further branches and a range of courses. TISS is the central source for actual course information over the WWW, but some of these courses have their own information system (mostly simple websites or e-learning platforms), where special details of the course are published like for example the slides of the lectures, the bibliography of learning resources, dates of events (lectures, exams, ...) or exercise sheets.

When a student wants to get an overview of the proposed resources (books, journal articles, web pages and other forms of media) for studying the content of a course, the student may have to scan web pages and lecture slides for collecting them. Furthermore the student has to search for a supplier for each resource that is not freely accessible over the WWW, like most books and journals. Resource lists management tools try to simplify this procedure. \begin{quote}On the subject of the user experience for the student, RLM tools have often been no more than electronic replicas of the paper based list. There has traditionally been little attempt to allow students to annotate items with regard to their intended use, or interact with content. Students could not feedback whether they have found items useful in attaining their learning goals, or add personal study notes. There has been no facility to allow the students themselves to form new collections or bibliographies of resources for a particular essay or group exercise.\cite{clarke_resource_2009}\end{quote} Resource lists, that are simply exposed on web pages or in lecture slides, are not a very convenient approach from the students perspective. Resource lists management tools can take Linked Open Data principles into consideration and link the resources to the suppliers (and especially to the local academic library, if possible). The students can give feedback to the resource list of the lecturer and create their own resource lists, which can on their part be rated by other students. Students can also comment respectively mark helpful sections of resources.

Talis\footnote{\url{https://talis.com/}} is such an application (see figure \ref{fig:rlm-aber-1}). It is used by various universities of the United Kingdom among others.
